#Game of Life

## The project

  Based on Conway's game of life, this project made in C
  was an opportunity for me to learn how to use SDL2 and to
  improve my C programming skills.

## How to use it?
  
### Building

  The build requires a C compiler (such as gcc or clang) and
  the SDL2 library

### Key bindings

  Keys:

  * **Left click**: places or removes cells on the grid
  * **Space**: runs the simulation in automatic mode. 
  Default update frequency is set to 10/s
  * **A**: advances of one step
  * **R**: reset the whole grid
  * **Arrow up/down**: multiplies or divides update frequency by 2*

## Conclusion

  I hope this project can be useful, it was really fun to work on it.
  I know the code can be messy and under-optimal, but I am not
  planning on working on it anymore. I'm a beginnner and am still
  learning ;)
